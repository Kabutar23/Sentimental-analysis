# Stock Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict the sentiment of stock-related news headlines and analyze its potential impact on stock market movements. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to automate the process of sentiment analysis on large volumes of textual data, providing insights into market sentiment and its correlation with stock prices.

## Sentiment Analysis Overview
Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a series of words. It helps in understanding the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed in text data. This analysis is particularly useful in the context of financial markets, where the sentiment expressed in news articles and social media can influence investor behavior and stock prices.

### Key Steps in Sentiment Analysis:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a dataset that includes news headlines related to stocks along with their sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the text data for analysis. This involves:
   - **Cleaning the Text**: Removing unwanted characters, punctuation, and stopwords.
   - **Tokenization**: Breaking down the text into individual words or tokens.
   - **Normalization**: Converting text to a consistent format, such as lowercasing all words.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning models. Techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are used to represent the importance of words in a document relative to the entire corpus.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Applying sentiment analysis tools, such as TextBlob or VADER, to score the sentiment of the text. These tools assign a polarity score to the text, indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
5. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models to predict sentiment based on the extracted features. Common models include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and neural networks.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Jupyter Notebook Implementation
The implementation of this project in the Jupyter Notebook involves several detailed steps:

1. **Loading the Dataset**
   - **Importing Libraries**: Essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and TextBlob are imported.
   - **Reading the Data**: The dataset containing stock-related news headlines and sentiment labels is read into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Cleaning the Text Data**: This involves removing special characters, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase.
   - **Combining Headlines**: Aggregating multiple headlines for each day into a single text block. This helps in capturing the overall sentiment for the day.

3. **Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob**
   - **Applying TextBlob**: Calculating the sentiment polarity of each combined text block using TextBlob. The sentiment polarity score ranges from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive).

4. **Feature Extraction with TF-IDF**
   - **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converting the cleaned text data into numerical features using TF-IDF. The TfidfVectorizer is configured to consider the top 1000 features to reduce dimensionality.

5. **Model Training**
   - **Splitting the Dataset**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
   - **Training Logistic Regression**: Using Logistic Regression to predict sentiment labels.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Predicting and Evaluating**: Making predictions on the test set and evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Work
Future iterations of this project could explore more advanced models and techniques to improve sentiment prediction:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful classifier that can be used for both linear and non-linear classification tasks.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing sequential dependencies in text data.
- **Transformer Models**: Such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for state-of-the-art NLP performance.

By using these models, we aim to provide robust sentiment analysis and better understand the impact of market sentiment on stock movements.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis of stock-related news headlines, leveraging machine learning techniques to predict and understand market sentiment. The implementation in the Jupyter Notebook covers data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, offering a solid foundation for further enhancements and applications in the field of financial sentiment analysis.
